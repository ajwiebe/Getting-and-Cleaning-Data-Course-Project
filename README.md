# The Data
The data was gathered from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. It was recorded by having subjects strap smartphones to their waists while they performed various activities. The data was initially stored in serveral files with sparse labels
# The Code
The code serves to combine the data, label it appropriately, and extract out variables of interest, mainly means and standard deviations. 
# The Result
The result is a final data frame which displays the mean for each variable and each activity for each subject. 
# Instrunctions 
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
